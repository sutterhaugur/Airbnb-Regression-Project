# Airbnb-Regression-Project
I predicted the prices of Airbnb listings in Chicago using various ML libraries. This repository contains my work from boosting, random-forrest and ensembling ML methodes. These models were trained on train data sets and were tested on test data sets. The goal of these models were to minimize the RMSE on the tests data sets.
